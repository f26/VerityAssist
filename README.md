# Verity Assist

This is a tool to help your fireteam get past the fourth encounter of the Salvation's Edge raid: Verity.

## How do?

Click/tap on the various callouts as your team calls them out.  The exact steps for both the outside team and the inside team will appear.  If you select invalid callouts, you will see an error (unless that failure case is not caught, then it may crash and/or give you wrong answers).

This source was forked from [Seratne's original source](https://github.com/seratne/salvations-edge-verity).  I modified it to generate and list the steps that the inside team has to do.
